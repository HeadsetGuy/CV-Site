                            This is the third school project made in the first<br>
                            year of the CMGT course. During this project we
                            had to find a solution for companies that had to
                            close due to the corona virus.<br> We found a
                            big aquarium in Portugal that suffered from the
                            results of corona. <br>
                            <br>
                            We found a creative solution
                            to this <br>by designing a virtual aquarium which <br>
                            needed promotional solutions. So the <br>
                            merchandise, the website and the game menu<br>
                            were designed by me.<br>

                            We got to make a house in a specific style. We used maya
                            for the 3d development options, and substance painter for
                            the textures.<br>
                            After this we had to upload our product to sketchfab<br>

                            During this project I worked on creating a poster <br>
                            that described who I was and what I want to represent.
                            So first we did research on what we wanted to present
                            to the rest of the world and then make a poster about that.
                            on the left you'll see the created poster.
