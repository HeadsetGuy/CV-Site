                        This is the third school project made in the first<br>
                        year of the CMGT course. During this project we
                        had to find a solution for companies that had to
                        close due to the corona virus.<br> We found a
                        big aquarium in Portugal that suffered from the
                        results of corona. <br>
                        <br>
                        We found a creative solution
                        to this <br>by designing a virtual aquarium which <br>
                        needed promotional solutions. So the <br>
                        merchandise, the website and the game menu<br>
                        were designed by me.<br>

                        This has been an assisnment we got in school.<br>
                        We got to make a house in a specific style. We used maya
                        for the 3d development options, and substance painter for
                        the textures.<br>
                        After this we had to upload our product to sketchfab<br>

                        During this project I worked on creating a poster <br>
                        that described who I was and what I want to represent.
                        So first we did research on what we wanted to present
                        to the rest of the world and then make a poster about that.
                        on the left you'll see the created poster.
