            <h2>
                Why you should play RuneScape 3
            </h2>

            <article>
                <br><br>
                So, why should you play Runescape 3? Although there will never be enough reasons to persuade someone to <br>
                “like” a game, this is completely player preference,<br>
                which someone else can never change. <br>
                Here are some reasons that you may like to play Runescape 3.<br>
                <br>
                Firstly, Runescape 3 follows the style of a lot of other MMO’s out there.<br>
                This is through features like the combat mechanics, using attack abilities with your hotkeys.<br>
                If you are someone who enjoys this type of playstyle, then Runescape 3 will be a good choice for a player like you.<br>
                <br>
                Another reason why you may like Runescape 3 is that it is actually the original game, <br>
                so if you were someone who had played the game many years ago,<br>
                your progress and items would still be there. <br>
                Many players do not wish to restart their progress and so they find it easy to just simply carry on playing Runescape 3.<br>
                <br>
                You may also prefer RS3 as the game has more skills that are unique to the game compared to Old school Runescape.<br>
                <br>
                For example, Runescape 3 contains skills such as the Divination or Invention skill,<br>
                which Old school Runescape does not have.<br>
                This can make the game more fun and interesting, especially for players who have already maxed out the other skills.<br>

            <h2>
                Why should you play OSRS?
            </h2>

            <article > 
                <br><br>
                There are several reasons why you should play the Old school RuneScape. Firstly,<br>
                if you were a player who had played the game many years ago, back when it was originally<br>
                in its 2007 form, you may find Old school RuneScape very nostalgic, allowing you to relive your childhood.<br>
                <br>
                The game is also getting reasonably updated in a way where it can keep its nostalgic form, while bringing out new, exciting updates.<br>
                This is also a little contradictory since RuneScape 3 has more proper updates.<br>
                <br>
                There is another reason why people enjoy Oldschool RuneScape more than RuneScape 3. It's because<br>
                Oldschool RuneScape has a bigger community. The game is invested with people who only play<br>
                the game for nostalgia's sake. Simply due to the unjustified hate for RuneScape 3.<br>
